# Predicting Patient No-Show Appointments using Socioeconomic Factors and Appointment Type

## Overview

This project analyzes healthcare patient data to develop a predictive model for identifying patients at high risk of missing appointments.  The analysis incorporates socioeconomic factors and appointment type to build a robust model capable of improving clinic efficiency and patient care by enabling proactive interventions.  The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings from the data analysis to the console, including descriptive statistics, model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and feature importance.  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) in the `output` directory, providing a visual representation of the data and model performance.  These files will include informative titles and labels.  The exact filenames may vary depending on the specific analysis performed.
